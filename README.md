A comprehensive log of AI/ML, featuring Kaggle labs, data cleaning, and statistical modeling.
# 🚀 AI/ML Learning Journey

This repository is a central hub for my progress in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. As a BSCS student, I am documenting every step—from raw data cleaning to advanced neural networks.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- **[01-Pandas-Foundations](./01-Pandas-Foundations):** Mastering data manipulation.
- **[02-Data-Cleaning-Lab](./02-Data-Cleaning-Lab):** Techniques for handling missing values, scaling, and normalization (Current Focus 🎯).
- **[03-Exploratory-Data-Analysis](./03-Exploratory-Data-Analysis):** Visualizing patterns using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

## 🛠️ Skills in Progress
- **Languages:** Python (NumPy, Pandas)
- **Concepts:** Data Imputation, Outlier Detection, Linear Algebra for ML.
- **Certifications:** Kaggle Data Cleaning (In Progress)
